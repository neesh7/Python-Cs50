# for i in [0,1,2]:
#     print('Meow')

# better way to write the above code
# for i in range(3):
#     print('Meow')

# # more pythonic way to write the above code as we are having 'i' but not using it we can use '_' which is a convention to tell that we are not going to use this variable
# for _ in range(3):
#     print('Meow')

print('Meow\n'*3, end="") # this is the most pythonic way to write the above code
