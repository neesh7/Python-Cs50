# Concurrency

Concurrency in Python means running multiple tasks seemingly at the same time to improve performance, especially for I/O-bound operations. It helps your program stay responsive and efficient by overlapping tasks rather than waiting for each to finish sequentially.

Concurrency is about managing multiple tasks at once (interleaving).
#### What to learn:
- **threading.Thread** and **asyncio module**
#### Why Use Concurrency:

- Handle multiple user inputs

- Speed up I/O-heavy tasks (e.g., file reads, API calls)

- Improve responsiveness in apps and agents

| 🧩 Model         | 🧰 Module        | 🚀 Best For                          |
|------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Threading        | `threading`      | I/O-bound tasks, shared memory       |
| Multiprocessing  | `multiprocessing`| CPU-bound tasks, true parallelism    |
| Async/Await      | `asyncio`        | High-performance I/O, event loops    |

#### For your agentic pipelines:

- Use asyncio for semantic retrieval and memo synthesis.

- Use multiprocessing for log scraping or heavy build analysis.

- Use threading for lightweight parallel tasks like file I/O or notifications.

## 🧠 Concurrency ≠ Parallelism
- Concurrency is like juggling: you're switching between tasks rapidly, giving each a slice of time.

- Parallelism is like having multiple jugglers — tasks truly run at the same time on multiple cores.

## 🔁 In Python (especially with asyncio):
- You're not using multiple threads or cores.

- Instead, you're using a single thread and event loop to interleave tasks.

- Each task yields control (via await) when it's waiting (e.g., for I/O), so another task can run.

- It’s not procedural — it’s cooperative multitasking.

## 🧪 Analogy
Imagine you're cooking:

- You boil water (takes time).

- While waiting, you chop veggies.

- Then you stir the sauce.

- You’re not doing everything at once, but you’re efficiently switching between tasks.

That’s concurrency.

## 🧩 In Your Agentic World
- Your semantic retriever can await a DB call while the formatter agent starts memo synthesis.

- You’re not running both on separate cores — you’re interleaving them smartly.

# Parallelism

- Running multiple task at once.
- Parallelism is about executing multiple tasks simultaneously (true multi-core execution).

#### What to learn :
- **multiprocessing.Process** and **concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor modules**.
