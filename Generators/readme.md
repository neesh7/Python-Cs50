## Generators
Generator generates but in function or in loop we get results immediatyl as everything is loaded into memory but in generators we generate one by one just like a stream

highly memory optimized

## Some basics
`yeild`, `from`, `next` , `close` and `send` keyword use.
- you save memory
- use in such cases where results isn't needed immedialtly
- Lazy evaluation
